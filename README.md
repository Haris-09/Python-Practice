# Challenge 1: Mathematical Calculations
## Problem Statement
Given a MathOp() function, try the following mathematical calculations and print the output:
```
(3 / 2)
(3 // 2)
(3 % 2)
(3**2)
```
## Output
The expected output:
```
1.5
1
1
9
```
# Challenge 2: Check Parity of a Number
## Problem Statement
Given a checkParity(n) function, write code to determine if a given number n is even or odd. Think of this as a function that returns 0 if the number is even, and 1 if it is odd. You have been given some starter code where the function and return statement have already been written, so don’t worry about any Python-specific details about functions; just implement the function logic!

## Input
A number

## Output
The parity of the number
# Challenge 3: Find Values Within a Range
## Problem Statement
Given an inRange(x,y) function, write a method that determines whether a given pair (x, y) falls in the range (x < 1/3 < y). Essentially, you’ll be implementing the body of a function that takes in two numbers x and y and returns True if x < 1/3 < y; otherwise, it returns False.

## Input
Two numbers, x and y

## Output
True if x and y are in the range and False otherwise.
# Challenge 4: String Transformation
## Problem Statement
Given a getStr() function, write the necessary sequence of operations to transform the string (containing three literals) in such a way that every literal is tripled​ respectively.

## Input
A string

## Output
Triple of every string literal

# Challenge 5: Find Index of a Specific Value in a String
## Problem Statement
Given a string, use a findOccurence(s) function that allows you to find the first occurrences of "b" and "ccc"​ in the string.

## Input
A string

## Output
The first occurrence of “b” and “ccc” in the string

## Sample Input
```
aaabbbccc
```

## Sample Output
```
[3, 6]
```

# Challenge 6: Lowercase to Uppercase
## Problem Statement
Given a function changeCase(s), the task is to convert the strings from upper case to lower case.

## Input
A string in upper case

## Output
Change case of the string in lower case

## Sample Input
```
“AAA BBB CCC”
```

## Sample Output
```
“aaa bbb ccc”
```
